1) Clone/pull/download: https://github.com/2pisoftware/cmfive-boilerplate
 - Position it nicely for WebServer to find
 - Match it to a CORE install (cmfive.php step[1] will clone MASTER from scratch)
 - Make symlinks etc as required
 - Apply any other usual cmfive setup steps!
 - Enable TestRunner in cmfive-boilerplate\config.php:
				Config::set("tests", array(
					"testrunner"  => "ENABLED"
				));

 FOR TEST ENVIRONMENT --> BEST TO PROCEED FROM HERE WITH DOCKER-"UP" FROM BOILERPLATE COMPOSE YML

 2) cm5 --> Install
    - TestRunner will need a 'volatile' database to work into.
	 - Use "cmfive.php" to manage chosen cm5 database

     - Create/Check cmfive-boilerplate config.php for all database settings
	       - use example to correctly configure DB executable commands and paths
		   - leave parameters as-is; these will be auto-filled
		   - these settings do not override any settings elsewhere (eg: in Admin module config)

		 - CHECK THE CONFIG WORKS -> test for backup and restore, examine files in cmfive-boilerplate\backups
	       - BE SURE YOU CAN ACCESS A BACKUP
		   
	 - Run : "Setup empty TestRunner DB and Administrator"
	       - once only
	       - backs up standing DB -> BUT ONLY IF backup config.php is correct!
		   - deletes all data -> CAN ONLY BE RECOVERED if your backup is good!
		   - runs all migrations & seeds test Admin user
		   - grabs snapshot of new 'empty' database to use for tests
	 
3) Codeception --> Install
	  - Use "test\.install\install.sh"
		- it will get a fresh "composer.phar" & pull Codeception source + modules, 
 			then "BOOTSTRAPS" codeception project environment
		- if you cannot use bash, follow all steps in the script per your own OS tools

4) Selenium support
	  - provisioned by Docker, copy settings from config.example on config.php
	  - customise if not using Docker 
	  
5) Check cmfive-boilerplate\test\Codeception\tests\acceptance.suite.dist.yml:
 	--> needs to match your cmfive WebServer & Browser & WebDriver
	  - provisioned from config.php
	  	  - copy settings from config.example on config.php
		  - set specifics for your DB (&Selenium if not using from Docker)

6) Execute in --> cmfive-boilerplate:
 	--> Use "cmfive.php" for TestRunner functions & as wrapper for command line tools
